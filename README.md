# movie_lottery // Python 3.4.3
first own project, exercise with classes + IMDB web scrapping

How to: 
DL all files and launch UI.py.

WIP
App for undecided people who managed to choose whole bunch of movies they want to watch... but are not able to choose from their list ONE movie for the evening. Maybe it'll save some relationships from utter ruin. ;)

So far:
- read and save from/to .csv,
- draw a movie and remove it from the list,
- scrap IMDB for retreiving poster,
- limit movies by duration,
- block drawing sequels, 
- shaky UI.


To do:
- remove unnecessary repeats (e.g. creating movie list twice!)
- add button for adding movies from the app, instead of editing .csv
- add button for updating the length of movies
- when saving, move movies with not found length at the beginning of the list for manual input (?)
- find why the picture is not destroyed! <-- SHAKY UI!!!
- add button "do you want to remove the movie from the list?)
- choose movies by genre, year of production
